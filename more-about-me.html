        <h1>General Info</h1>
        <p>am 16 years old and I live in Belgium - Flanders. I still go to high school where I study economics, but all the time after school I spend on Web development or programming in general, also I spend some time on 3d modeling and game development.</p>

        <h1>
          School?
        </h1>
        <p>
          school is often the least enjoyable thing I do, but sometimes there are good moments. As I said I'm in high school and studying economics the subjects I like are English, physical education and history. I don't find other languages interesting and I find it more difficult.

          Hobbies?
        </h1>
        <p>
          I don't have many hobbies, but I like the ones I have. I really like to play Guitar and Drums, in addition I play everything in the percussion category, for example marimba and vibraphone, etc. My biggest "hobby" is of course programming, but I also skate a lot wiht friends. besides these 3 I do very few other things as a hobby that I love.

        <h1>How did i start?</h1>
        <p>Since I was 13 I started with C# and unity game engine, but it wasn't until I was 14 that I started web development and made my first website. fast forward 2 years and I like to create projects with Python, Js and C#. Mostly I focus on web development but I also like scripting in python and making simple 3d games with C# in unity. I'm currently learning Node.js and from there I'm going to learn a lot more technologies and go into a lot of backend.</p>

      <div class="item">
        <h1>
          What do i do now?
        </h1>
        <p>
          I'm still looking at what I want to do maybe Data Science, Machine learning, Ai or back-end, Front-end, Full-stack, but what I know for sure is that Web Development is now my focus. Second I do some things in pyton such as automation for myself and discord bots.
        </p>

      <div class="item">
        <h1>
          What am i planning to learn?
        </h1>
        <p>
          Every day I try to learn new things I now focus on front-end with react, but soon I also want to delve into backend with node.js and learn a lot about databases especially MongoDB.
        </p>

        <h1>
          projects i did and plan to do.
        </h1>
        <p>
          As my first projects I made a todo app and a discord bot after that I made some statistical websites. In the end I experimented and learned a lot of Js and used react. The projects that I will start soon is a general purpose bot fully written in Javascript, but also a large online platform that I will tell more about later.

     I don't have many hobbies, but I like the ones I have. I really like to play Guitar and Drums, in addition I play everything in the percussion category, for example marimba and vibraphone, etc. My biggest "hobby" is of course programming. besides these 2 I do very few other things as a hobby that I love a lot.

    School?
  </h1>
  <p>
    school is often the least enjoyable thing I do, but sometimes there are good moments. As I said I'm in high school and studying economics the subjects I like are English, physical education and history. I don't find other languages interesting and I find it more difficult.

    <p>
      Since I was 13 I started with C# and unity game engine, but it wasn't until I was 14 that I started web development and made my first website. fast forward 2 years and I like to create projects with Python, Js and C#. Mostly I focus on web development but I also like scripting in python and making simple 3d games with C# in unity. I'm currently learning Node.js and from there I'm going to learn a lot more technologies and go into a lot of backend.
